<h1>Local Showcase: The Autumn Spirit Experiment</h1>
<p>The Autumn Spirit Experiment is the avant-gaze-ers' attempt at soaring, shimmering, indie pocket rock. The result? Blistering, crowd-pleasing, spare art-psych. Perfect for a road trip during a thunderstorm at the beach.</p>
<p>$5 adv / $7 day of show</p>

<h1>Acoustic Night: Small Prune</h1>
<p>Small Prune sounds like Austin-flavored Link Wray on sleepytime tea, drawing influences from Tom Waits and Yoko Ono, with a knowing nod to (the criminally underrated) Stereolab.</p>
